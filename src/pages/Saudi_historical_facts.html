        <p>Saudi Arabia traces its roots back to the earliest civilizations of the Arabian Peninsula. Over the
            centuries, the peninsula has played an important role in history as an ancient trade center and as the
            birthplace of Islam, one of the world’s major monotheistic religions.<br><br>

            Since King Abdulaziz Al-Saud established the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, its transformation has
            been astonishing.<br><br>

            In a few short decades, the Kingdom has turned itself from a desert nation to a modern, sophisticated state
            and a major player on the international stage.</p>

        <h1>Early History</h1><br>
        <p>The first concrete evidence of human presence in the Arabian Peninsula dates back 15,000 to 20,000 years.
            Bands of hunter-gatherers roamed the land, living off wild animals and plants.<br><br>

            As the European ice cap melted during the last Ice Age, some 15,000 years ago, the climate in the peninsula
            became dry. Vast plains once covered with lush grasslands gave way to scrubland and deserts, and wild
            animals vanished. River systems also disappeared, leaving in their wake the dry river beds (wadis) that are
            found in the peninsula today.<br><br>

            This climate change forced humans to move into the lush mountain valleys and oases. No longer able to
            survive as hunter-gatherers, they had to develop another means of survival. As a result, agriculture
            developed – first in Mesopotamia, then the Nile River Valley, and eventually spreading across the Middle
            East.<br><br>

            The development of agriculture brought other advances. Pottery allowed farmers to store food. Animals,
            including goats, cattle, sheep, horses and camels, were domesticated, and people abandoned hunting
            altogether. These advances made intensive farming possible. In turn, settlements became more permanent,
            leading to the foundations of what we call civilization – language, writing, political systems, art and
            architecture.</p>

        <h1>The First Saudi State</h1><br>
        <p>In the early 18th century, a Muslim scholar and reformer named Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab began
            advocating a return to the original form of Islam. Abdul Wahhab was initially persecuted by local religious
            scholars and leaders who viewed his teachings as a threat to their power bases. He sought protection in the
            town of Diriyah, which was ruled by Muhammad bin Saud.

            <br><br>

            Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and Muhammad bin Saud formed an agreement to dedicate themselves to restoring the
            pure teachings of Islam to the Muslim community. In that spirit, bin Saud established the First Saudi State
            in 1727, which prospered under the spiritual guidance of bin Abdul Wahhab, known simply as the
            Shaikh.<br><br>

            <p class="imageflexcontent">
                By 1788, the Saudi State ruled over the entire central plateau known as the Najd. By the early 19th
                century,
                its rule extended to most of the Arabian Peninsula, including Makkah and Madinah.<br><br>

                The popularity and success of the Al-Saud rulers aroused the suspicion of the Ottoman Empire, the
                dominant
                power in the Middle East and North Africa at the time. In 1818, the Ottomans dispatched a large
                expeditionary force armed with modern artillery to the western region of Arabia. The Ottoman army
                besieged
                Diriyah, which by now had grown into one of the largest cities in the peninsula. Ottoman forces leveled
                the
                city with field guns and made it permanently uninhabitable by ruining the wells and uprooting date
                palms.

        <h1>The Second Saudi State</h1><br>
        <p>By 1824, the Al-Saud family had regained political control of central Arabia. The Saudi ruler Turki bin
            Abdullah Al-Saud transferred his capital to Riyadh, some 20 miles south of Diriyah, and established the
            Second Saudi State. During his 11-year rule, Turki succeeded in retaking most of the lands lost to the
            Ottomans. As he expanded his rule, he took steps to ensure that his people enjoyed rights, and he saw to
            their well-being.

                Under Turki and his son, Faisal, the Second Saudi State enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity, and
                trade and agriculture flourished. The calm was shattered in 1865 by a renewed Ottoman campaign to extend
                its Middle Eastern empire into the Arabian Peninsula. Ottoman armies captured parts of the Saudi State,
                which was ruled at the time by Faisal’s son, Abdulrahman. With the support of the Ottomans, the
                Al-Rashid family of Hail made a concerted effort to overthrow the Saudi State.<br><br>

                Faced with a much larger and better equipped army, Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud was forced to abandon
                his struggle in 1891. He sought refuge with the Bedouin tribes in the vast sand desert of eastern Arabia
                known as the Rub’ Al-Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter.’ From there, Abdulrahman and his family traveled to
                Kuwait, where they stayed until 1902. With him was his young son Abdulaziz, who was already making his
                mark as a natural leader and a fierce warrior for the cause of Islam.

        <h1>The Modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</h1><br>
        <p>The young Abdulaziz was determined to regain his patrimony from the Al-Rashid family, which had taken over
            Riyadh and established a governor and garrison there. In 1902, Abdulaziz, – accompanied by only 40 followers
            – staged a daring night march into Riyadh to retake the city garrison, known as the Masmak Fortress. This
            legendary event marks the beginning of the formation of the modern Saudi state.

                On September 23, 1932, the country was named the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an Islamic state with Arabic
                as its national language and the Holy Qur’an as its constitution.
